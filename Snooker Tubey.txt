**The Rules (sort of)**

# Snooker Tubey: Ruleset

## Overview

A twist on traditional snooker, combining cue skill with geographic knowledge of London's iconic transport network. Players must call out a valid Underground, Overground, or Elizabeth Line station that corresponds with the colour of the ball potted, based on the official Tube map.

## 1\. Basic Gameplay Integration

- Play proceeds as in standard snooker: pot a red, then a colour, repeat.
- After each coloured ball is potted, the player must immediately call out a London station that matches the colour's assigned line(s) according to the rules below.
- Stations can only be used once per game (unless modified by Tiering or Wildcard rules).
  - A valid station must be on the official TfL map and match the colour rules.
  - Players have **10 seconds** to call a station after potting a colour; failure results in a forfeit of that shot's points and the end of their turn.

## 2\. Colour-to-Line Assignments

| **Ball Colour** | **Primary Line(s)** | **Backup Line(s)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Red** | Central | Metropolitan & Weaver |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Yellow** | Circle | Lioness |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Green** | District | Suffragette |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Brown** | Bakerloo | Windrush |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Blue** | Piccadilly | Victoria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pink** | Hammersmith & City | Elizabeth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Black** | Northern | Jubilee |
| --- | --- | --- |

- **Overground Lines:** Distributed across multiple colours to increase flexibility. Note the specific branches assigned.
- **Interchanges:** Stations serving multiple lines can count for _any_ of their associated lines, provided the line matches the colour potted.

## 3\. Station Usage Rules

- Once a station is called correctly, it is "locked" and cannot be reused (unless modified by Wildcard rules or Station Reuse Tiering).
- **Valid stations must:**
  - Be currently active on the official TfL map.
  - Fall within Zones 1-6 (optional house rule).
  - Match the colour line(s) associated with the ball potted (see Section 2).
- **Incorrect station call** (e.g., wrong line, already used, not on TfL map, out of time) results in:
  - 4-point penalty **OR**
  - Ball-in-hand for opponent (decide as a house rule before starting).
  - The player's turn ends.

## 4\. Advanced Options

- **Station Reuse Tiering:**
  - _Casual:_ Stations are reusable.
  - _Intermediate:_ Each station may be used twice per game.
  - _Advanced:_ Strict one-time use per station per game.
- **Out-of-Stations Rule:**
  - If a player believes no valid, unused stations remain for a required line, they may:
    - Use a station from an assigned Backup Line for that colour, **OR**
    - Call an Interchange station that serves the required line (even if primarily known for other lines).
    - If challenged and incorrect, the standard penalty applies. If correct, play continues.
- **Overground Wildcard Feature (Optional):**
  - Once per game, immediately after potting _any_ coloured ball, a player may choose to call out a station on _any_ **London Overground** line (regardless of the colour potted).
  - If the Overground station call is valid, they **unlock one previously used station**, making it available to be called again later in the game by either player. The player must declare which station is being unlocked.
  - This wildcard call replaces the standard requirement to name a station matching the potted colour for that shot. Points for the potted ball are still scored.
- **Scoring Modifier (Optional):**
  - +1 bonus point for naming a Zone 1 station.
  - +2 bonus points for naming an interchange station served by 3 or more lines (Underground, Overground, DLR, Elizabeth Line).

## 5\. Team Play Variant (Optional)

- 2v2 or teams of more players may compete.
- Teammates may consult on station names but _not_ on cue shots.
- Players take turns potting; station calls are collaborative for the team whose turn it is. Used stations are tracked for the whole game, not per team.

## 6\. Optional Tools

- Use a printable reference chart for colour-to-line mapping.
- Use a whiteboard or app to track used stations.
- Digital tools (shared spreadsheets, online trackers) can help in remote or pub settings.
- QR codes linking to TfL station lists or the official map can be added to physical game aids.

_This ruleset is intended as a template. Adjustments and player testing are encouraged!_

**Colour-to-Line Ref**

## Snooker Tubey: Colour-to-Line Reference Chart

Use this chart to quickly identify which London Underground, Overground, or Elizabeth lines correspond to the snooker ball colour potted. Remember to call out a valid station on one of the associated lines within 10 seconds!

| Ball Colour | Primary Line(s) | Backup Line(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red | Central | Metropolitan & Weaver |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yellow | Circle | Lioness |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Green | District | Suffragette |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brown | Bakerloo | Windrush |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blue | Piccadilly | Victoria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pink | Hammersmith & City | Elizabeth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Black | Northern | Jubilee |
| --- | --- | --- |

**Key Reminders:**

- **Interchanges:** Stations that serve multiple lines (interchanges) can be used for _any_ of the lines that pass through them, provided the line matches the colour potted according to the chart above.
- **Station Validity:** Ensure the station called is currently active on the official TfL map and hasn't already been used in the game (depending on the Station Reuse Tiering rule being played).
- **Backup Lines:** Use backup lines if needed, especially under the "Out-of-Stations" rule.
- **Overground Wildcard (Optional):** Once per game, after potting _any_ colour, you may call an **Overground** station (any branch) to unlock one previously used station. This replaces the standard station call for that shot.

**Google Sheet Track**

## Snooker Tubey - Google Sheet Tracker Template

Using a shared Google Sheet is an excellent and highly recommended way to digitally track used stations during your Snooker Tubey game. It's particularly useful for remote play, or if you simply prefer a digital, easily searchable, and collaborative method over a physical whiteboard.

**Benefits:**

- **Searchable & Filterable:** Quickly check if a station has been used, its valid lines/colours, or its zone.
- **Collaborative:** Multiple players can view or edit the sheet simultaneously (if permissions are set).
- **Flexible:** Adapts to different Station Reuse Tiering rules, especially when used with the companion Apps Script.
- **Persistent:** Game data is saved automatically.
- **Accurate Tracking:** Ensures clear and consistent application of station usage rules.

### Recommended Columns

For the tracker to work seamlessly with the provided Google Apps Script and your game rules, the following column order and setup are crucial:

- **Column A:** Station Name
  - **Purpose:** The official name of the London Underground, Overground, Elizabeth Line, or DLR station.
  - **Data Source:** TfL website station list, the index from the official map PDF, or your "Snooker Tubey Database - Main Base.csv". Ensure consistent naming for script accuracy.
- **Column B:** Lines Served
  - **Purpose:** Lists all the lines that stop at this station (e.g., "Central, Northern", "Piccadilly", "Elizabeth Line, H&C", "Overground (Windrush)").
  - **Data Source:** TfL website or map. Be specific, especially with Overground branches.
- **Column C:** Valid for Colours
  - **Purpose:** Shows which snooker ball colours this station can be called for, based on the lines it serves and your game's Colour-to-Line rules.
  - **Example:** If a station serves Central and Bakerloo, this might be "Red, Brown".
  - **Data Source:** Derived by mapping the Lines Served column to your game's Colour-to-Line chart.
- **Column D:** Zone(s)
  - **Purpose:** The TfL fare zone(s) the station is in (e.g., "1", "2/3", "6").
  - **Data Source:** TfL website or map. Useful for the optional scoring modifier.
- **Column E:** Times Used (This Game)
  - **Purpose:** **This is the primary manual input column during gameplay.** It tracks how many times a station has been successfully called in the current game. This number directly informs the Apps Script whether a station should be locked.
  - **Data Type:** Number (e.g., 0, 1, 2).
  - **Initial State:** Set to 0 for all stations at the start of a new game.
- **Column F:** Currently Locked?
  - **Purpose:** A clear indicator (e.g., "Yes" or "No") showing if the station is available to be called. **This column is automatically updated by the Apps Script** based on the value in Times Used (This Game) and the selected game tier.
  - **Setup:** It's highly recommended to set this column up with Data Validation to be a dropdown list with "Yes" and "No" options. However, remember that the script will overwrite manual selections in this column when its update functions are run.
  - **Initial State:** Should be "No" for all stations at the start of a new game (the script's reset function handles this).
- **Column G:** Notes
  - **Purpose:** Optional field for any reminders, e.g., "Unlocked via Wildcard on Turn 5 by Player A". The Apps Script's "Unlock Station" function will automatically add a note here.
  - **Initial State:** Blank at the start of a new game.
- **(Optional) Column H (or later):** Official TFL Line Colour
  - **Purpose:** Can be used for quick visual reference or advanced filtering if desired. Not used by the current Apps Script.

### Setting Up Your Sheet

- **Create a New Google Sheet.**
- **Add the Columns:** Create headers for the columns listed above, **in the specified order**. This is vital for the Apps Script to function correctly without modification.
- **Populate Station Data:**
  - This is the most time-consuming initial step. You can copy/paste station names from the TfL website, your "Snooker Tubey Database - Main Base.csv", or the PDF index.
  - Fill in Lines Served, Valid for Colours, and Zone(s) for each station.
  - _Tip:_ Start with Zones 1-3 or key interchanges and add more as needed.
- **Initial State for Gameplay Columns:**
  - Ensure all entries in Times Used (This Game) are 0.
  - Ensure all entries in Currently Locked? are No.
  - Ensure Notes are cleared.
  - _(The Apps Script resetBoardForNewGame function will handle this for subsequent games)._
- **Data Validation for "Currently Locked?":**
  - Select Column F (or the cells in that column where you have station data).
  - Go to "Data" > "Data validation".
  - For "Criteria", choose "List of items".
  - Enter "Yes,No" (without quotes, comma-separated) in the box.
  - Ensure "Show dropdown list in cell" is checked.
  - Click "Save".

### Using the Google Apps Script (Essential for Automation)

The companion Google Apps Script (detailed in "Snooker Tube Game - Google Apps Script Logic" or as provided separately) is designed to automate the management of station locking.

- **Custom Menu:** Once the script is added to your sheet (via Tools > Script editor), it will add a custom menu named "Snooker Game Helper" to your Google Sheet UI when you open the file.
- **Core Functionality:**
  - Update Station Locks (Advanced Tier) / Update Station Locks (Intermediate Tier): These functions read the numeric value in the Times Used (This Game) column for each station. Based on this count and the tier selected, they automatically set the Currently Locked? column to "Yes" or "No".
  - Unlock Station (for Wildcard): Prompts for a station name, then sets its Times Used (This Game) to 0, Currently Locked? to "No", and adds a note.
  - Reset All Stations for New Game: Sets Times Used (This Game) to 0, Currently Locked? to "No", and clears Notes for all stations.

### Using the Tracker During Gameplay: The Correct Workflow

- **Player Pots a Colour & Calls a Station:**
  - Example: Player pots Green, calls "Victoria".
- **Verify Station:**
  - Quickly search or filter your sheet for "Victoria".
  - Check:
    - Does its Valid for Colours column include "Green"?
    - Is its Currently Locked? status "No"?
- **If Valid and Not Locked:**
  - **Manually update** Times Used (This Game)**:** Go to the "Victoria" row and increment the number in its Times Used (This Game) cell (e.g., if it was 0, change it to 1).
  - **Run the Script to Update Lock Status:** Click "Snooker Game Helper" > "Update Station Locks (Advanced Tier)" (or "Intermediate Tier", depending on your rules). The script will then automatically change the Currently Locked? status for "Victoria" (and any other affected stations) to "Yes".
  - Award points (and bonus points if applicable).
- **If Invalid or Already Locked:**
  - Apply penalty as per your game rules.
  - **Do not** change Times Used (This Game). The Currently Locked? status should already reflect its locked state from a previous script update.
- **Important Note on Manual Overrides:**
  - Manually changing the Currently Locked? dropdown from "No" to "Yes" (or vice-versa) **will NOT automatically update the** Times Used (This Game) **column.** The script's logic flows from Times Used (This Game) to Currently Locked?. Always update Times Used (This Game) first, then run the script.
- **Using Wildcard:**
  - If a player uses the Overground Wildcard to unlock a station:
    - Use the "Snooker Game Helper" > "Unlock Station (for Wildcard)" menu item.
    - Enter the station name when prompted. The script will reset its usage and lock status.
- **Starting a New Game:**
  - Use the "Snooker Game Helper" > "Reset All Stations for New Game" menu item to prepare the sheet.

### (Optional) Advanced Sheet Features

- **Conditional Formatting:** You can make locked stations more visible.
  - Select your data range (excluding headers).
  - Go to "Format" > "Conditional formatting".
  - Set a rule: If "Custom formula is" and enter a formula like =\$F2="Yes" (assuming Currently Locked? is Column F and your data starts in row 2).
  - Choose a formatting style (e.g., grey background, strikethrough text).
- **Filtering:** Use Google Sheets' filter feature (Data > Create a filter) to easily find stations by line, colour, zone, or locked status during play.

**Offline Version**

## Guide: Creating a Printable Station Checklist for Snooker Tubey

This guide will help you create a printable checklist of London Underground, Overground, Elizabeth Line, and DLR stations. This is a great backup in case digital tools (like the web app or Google Sheet) are unavailable due to no internet or other issues.

### Why a Printable Checklist?

- **Offline Access:** Works anywhere, no internet needed.
- **Simple Tracking:** Easy to physically mark off used stations.
- **Focused Play:** Minimizes screen time if you prefer.

### Step 1: Obtain the Station List

The most crucial part is getting an accurate and comprehensive list of stations.

- **Primary Source (Recommended for up-to-date info):**
  - **TfL Website:** The official Transport for London website (tfl.gov.uk) usually has an A-Z list of all stations. Search for "TfL station A-Z" or similar. This will be the most current list.
  - You can usually copy the text directly from the webpage.
- **Secondary Source (From your uploaded file):**
  - standard-tube-map.pdf**:** The PDF map you uploaded contains an "Index to stations" (usually on the second page). You can:
    - Manually type out the stations from this index.
    - Use a PDF-to-Text converter (many free online tools available) to try and extract the text, though you'll need to clean it up.

### Step 2: Choose Your Tool for Creating the Checklist

You have several options, depending on your preference and desired formatting:

- **Simple Text Editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit):**
  - **Pros:** Very basic, quick to get started.
  - **Cons:** Limited formatting options (e.g., no easy checkboxes, columns might be tricky).
  - **How:** Just paste or type the station names, one per line. You can add \[ \] before each name to manually create a checkbox placeholder.
- **Word Processor (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft Word):**
  - **Pros:** Good formatting control, can create columns, use bullet points with checkbox symbols, control font sizes.
  - **Cons:** Might be slightly more effort to set up than a plain text file.
  - **How:**
    - Paste the station list.
    - Select the list and apply a bullet point style that uses a checkbox symbol (many word processors have this).
    - Format into multiple columns (e.g., 2 or 3 columns per page) to save paper and make it easier to scan. Go to Layout/Format > Columns.
- **Spreadsheet Program (e.g., Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel):**
  - **Pros:** Excellent for organizing data. You can easily sort stations alphabetically. You could even add columns for "Line(s)" or "Zone(s)" if you want that detail on your printout, though it might make it very dense.
  - **Cons:** Might be overkill if you just need a simple checklist.
  - **How:**
    - Paste station names into one column.
    - In the next column, you can manually add \[ \] or leave it blank for ticking.
    - Sort alphabetically.
    - When printing, adjust print settings (e.g., "Fit to width," scale down) to get as many stations on a page as is readable. You can also select only the station name column and a blank column next to it for printing.

### Step 3: Format Your Checklist for Print

- **Alphabetical Order:** This is highly recommended for quick look-ups during the game.
- **Columns:** Use 2, 3, or even 4 columns per page to make the list more compact and save paper. Ensure the font size is still legible.
- **Checkbox/Space:** Make sure there's a clear way to mark a station as used:
  - \[ \] Station Name
  - ☐ Station Name
  - Or just leave enough space to tick or cross out: Station Name \___
- **Font Size:** Choose a clear, readable font (e.g., Arial, Calibri, Helvetica) at a reasonable size (e.g., 9-11pt, depending on columns).
- **Page Numbers:** Useful if your list spans multiple pages.
- **Optional - "Times Used" Boxes (for Intermediate Tier):** If you frequently play the Intermediate tier (stations can be used twice), you could add two small checkbox placeholders per station:
  - \[ \] \[ \] Station Name

### Step 4: Print and Use

- **Print:** Once your checklist is formatted, print it out. Consider printing a few copies.
- **During the Game:**
  - When a station is correctly called, find it on your list and mark it off (tick the box, cross it out, etc.).
  - If playing Intermediate, mark it once for the first use, and again for the second.
  - If a station is unlocked via the Overground Wildcard, you could circle the checkmark or make a note to indicate it's available again (or simply erase the mark if using pencil).
